# About me

<img src="headshot.jpg" alt="headshot" width="36.5%" style="padding-right: 20px; padding-top: 7px; float: left;"/>

I currently build and manage end-to-end analytics infrastructure for a US natural gas and power trading team at Millennium Management. This involves a mix of data science and engineering and is written primarily with Python and SQL. 

Prior to working at Millennium, I completed my BS and MS in Meteorology and Atmospheric Science at Penn State, where I studied processes that drive the formation and evolution of Arctic mixed-phase stratocumulus clouds. I also spent a winter taking courses in Arctic geophysics in Svalbard, which included a week-long expedition on an icebreaker. 

My interests currently lie at the intersection of energy, weather, and data science/engineering. I live in New York City.
